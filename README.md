# AdventOfCode_Java_2018


## Introduction 
This is some kind of a wirte up for the Advent_of_Code Challenges.
I'm studying computer science third term so don't expect peak performance or anything super special. 
It's just a fun project along the normal work for my studies. +

All Days are completly independent, each is contained within a gradle project. 
Until now (Day 4) I don't see the need of extra documentation but 
I commented my code with as many comments as i think are needed to get a decent understanding. 
If you got any questions feel free to contact me here or on Twitter @Grimaldus06.
